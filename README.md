# Blockchain-Scalability-PoW-Complexity-and-Security-Threats-Analysis
This repository contains the advanced cybersecurity assignment focused on analyzing blockchain technology. The project explores three main aspects:
1. **Scalability:** Examines how transaction volume affects blockchain performance, including CPU and RAM usage.

2. **Proof of Work (PoW) Complexity:** Investigates the impact of varying PoW difficulty and different hashing algorithms on block validation times.

3. **Security Threats:** Analyzes potential security threats to blockchain systems, including hash collision vulnerabilities and methods for mitigating these threats.

This report was created to complete an aspect of the advanced cybersecurity assignment for the University of Huddersfield. The repository includes detailed methods, experimental analysis, and discussions on the implications of findings for blockchain technology.
